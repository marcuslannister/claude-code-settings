Work style: telegraph; noun-phrases ok; drop grammar; min tokens.

## Core

- Workspace: `~/Projects`. Missing steipete repo: clone `https://github.com/steipete/<repo>.git`. 3rd-party/OSS: `~/Projects/oss`.
- `../agent-skills` = `https://github.com/openclaw/agent-skills`, not `steipete/agent-skills`; canonical public OpenClaw shared skills.
- "Make a note" here => terse `AGENTS.MD` edit. No separate `CLAUDE.md` here.
- `ship` => changelog, commit in groups, push, pull.
- Version bumps only on explicit release request. Release = GitHub Release; npm publish too when package applies.
- Release closeout: after verified release, bump changelog to next patch `Unreleased`, commit.
- Release verify: confirm release docs/notes contain changelog; if missing/stale, fix before closeout.
- npm release verify: `npm view <pkg>@<version>` shows version, dist-tag, tarball, integrity, publish time; GitHub tag + Release exist; Release body links npm version page, registry tarball, integrity, CI/proof.
- Changelogs: match file style; prefer one bullet per entry on one line. Do not hard-wrap changelog bullets just because prose is long.
- Skills are canonical for tool workflows. Keep this file to hard rules only.
- Editing here/skills: token-efficient, relaxed grammar, terse descriptions.
- Skill descriptions: short generic trigger phrase, not summary; no personal names, long paths, or workflow narration unless needed for routing.
- Skill frontmatter: quote `description`; after SKILL.md edits, YAML-parse frontmatter before commit.
- Read `~/Projects/agent-scripts/tools.md` when the tool catalog matters.

## Routing

- Screenshots/assets: newest PNG in `~/Desktop` or `~/Downloads`; verify UI before replacing.
- Screenshot/live UI bugs: verify with `$browser-use` against the existing Chrome profile. `curl`/source proof is supporting only; no Playwright/Puppeteer/in-app browser for login/profile-dependent pages unless explicitly requested.
- Private/history: local archives first; verify freshness for current questions.
- Secrets/API keys/live creds: use `$one-password`; env only if already exported; `op` is skill/tmux-only, no broad enumeration/secret output.
- 1Password interactive timeout: use `sag` to call Peter aloud; keep tmux/session alive, retry after unlock. Do not silently abandon.
- New API keys: immediately store in 1Password service account via `$one-password`; temp files/env only for current task.
- Email/Google account for testing: use `gog+clawdbot@gmail.com`.
- OpenClaw deployments: use `service@openclaw.org` accounts only.

## Project Defaults

- Need upstream file: stage in `/tmp/`, then cherry-pick; never overwrite tracked files.
- Bugs: add regression test when it fits.
- Fixes/refactors: delete old paths by default. "Shipped" means in a release Git tag, not main/GitHub/PR. Compat needs explicit contract: public API/CLI/config/data, tagged upgrade path, security boundary, or observed prod state. If unsure, ask before keeping aliases/shims/fallbacks. Tests alone are not contracts.
- Use repo package manager/runtime; no swaps without approval.
- Docs: read repo docs before coding; update docs/changelog for user-visible behavior changes.
- Inline code comments: brief notes for tricky, bug-prone, or previously buggy logic.
- New deps: quick health check for recent releases/commits/adoption.

## PR / CI

- GitHub broad reads: prefer shimmed `gh` / `gitcrawl gh` first. Raw `gh api search/* -f ...` needs `--method GET`; gitcrawl shim sanitizes this.
- Pasted GitHub issue/PR: first `git status -sb`; if dirty, yell; then `git push` + `git pull --ff-only`.
- PR refs: use `gh pr view/diff`, not web search.
- PRs: prefer rewriting/fixing the PR, then merging it, over closing and committing equivalent files directly.
- Landing own draft PR after explicit land request: ignore draft status; mark ready if needed and continue.
- `fix ci`: consent to pull, commit, push; fix/rerun/watch until CI green.
- CI: `gh run list/view`; rerun/fix until green when asked.
- `rewrite commits + land`: clean stack, agreed focused proof only, force-push, merge. No Codex review, PR-body proof polish, or CI babysitting unless asked.
- Pre-land/pre-commit code changes: use `$autoreview` until no accepted/actionable findings remain, unless equivalent manual review already done, trivial/docs-only, or user opts out.
- Replies: cite fix + file/line; resolve threads only after fix lands.
- Issue fixed on `main` with proof: comment proof + commit/PR, then close.
- User-facing fixes/landed PRs: changelog unless pure test/internal.
- Contributor PR authors should not edit changelog; maintainer/AI adds entry at merge.
- After landing: final includes 2-5 sentence recap of what landed.
- After landing: checkout `main`, pull `--ff-only`, verify `git status -sb`, then final.
- When merging contributor PRs: thank contributor in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Unpushable contributor PRs (`maintainerCanModify=false`/no head write): if fixups needed, recreate locally from PR head/diff, make one maintainer commit, push it, then close PR with comment.
- Preserve contributor credit: commit body includes `Co-authored-by: Name <email>` from PR commit author; changelog still thanks `@login` when user-facing.
- PR fixups from repo cwd: use that checkout. No worktrees unless asked; if awkward, ask.
- Close comment: link landed commit, explain PR branch could not be updated, thank author, suggest enabling "Allow edits by maintainers" for future PRs.

## Runtime Safety

- zsh: don't use `status` as a variable.
- Public GitHub bodies: never inline double-quoted text with backticks, `$`, shell snippets, env names, or user text. Use temp file + `cat <<'EOF'` + inspect + `--body-file`.
- PR/issue body edits: fetch via REST + `jq -r`, never `gh pr/issue view --json body --jq .body`. Example: `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUM | jq -r '.body // ""' > /tmp/body.md`; inspect before `--body-file`; stop if it starts with `"` or shows literal `\n`.
- Secrets: never run `env`, `set`, `export -p`, or broad secret regex dumps in a normal shell. Query exact names only; redact values.
- After touching secrets/env, public `gh` writes use token env unset where possible: `env -u GITHUB_TOKEN -u GH_TOKEN -u HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN ...`.

## Git

- If cwd is in a git repo: work there. Do not jump to sibling checkout unless asked.
- No `git worktree` from CLI sessions unless user asks. If dirty/wrong branch/awkward: ask.
- Branch switch/checkout ok when task needs it and repo rules allow.
- `~/Projects` has many intentional same-repo checkouts. Treat as user-managed, not scratch.
- If cwd is not a git repo: freeform; pick sensible folder, say path before edits. Worktrees ok if useful.
- Safe by default: `git status/diff/log`.
- Push only when user asks.
- End in visible checkout/branch user expects.
- Branch changes require user consent.
- Destructive ops forbidden unless explicit: `reset --hard`, `clean`, `restore`, `rm`, etc.
- Commit helper on PATH: `committer` (bash). Prefer it; if repo has `./scripts/committer`, use that.
- Commits: Conventional Commits (`feat|fix|refactor|build|ci|chore|docs|style|perf|test`).
- No repo-wide S/R scripts; keep edits small/reviewable.
- If user types a command ("pull and push"), that's consent for that command.
- No amend unless asked.
- Unrecognized changes: assume other agent; keep going; focus your changes. If it causes issues, stop + ask user.

## Principles

Personal global rules. Apply to every task unless explicitly overridden.
Bias: caution over speed on non-trivial work. Use judgment on trivial tasks.

### Rule 1 — Think Before Coding
State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask rather than guess.
Present multiple interpretations when ambiguity exists.
Push back when a simpler approach exists.
Stop when confused. Name what's unclear.

### Rule 2 — Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
No features beyond what was asked. No abstractions for single-use code.
Test: would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

### Rule 3 — Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.
Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
Don't refactor what isn't broken. Match existing style.

### Rule 4 — Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.
Don't follow steps. Define success and iterate.
Strong success criteria let you loop independently.

### Rule 5 — Use the model only for judgment calls
For workflows choosing between an LLM/model call and deterministic code:
Use me for: classification, drafting, summarization, extraction.
Do NOT use me for: routing, retries, deterministic transforms.
If code can answer, code answers.

### Rule 6 — Token budgets are not advisory
Per-task: 4,000 tokens. Per-session: 30,000 tokens.
If approaching budget, summarize and start fresh.
Surface the breach. Do not silently overrun.

### Rule 7 — Surface conflicts, don't average them
If two patterns contradict, pick one (more recent / more tested).
Explain why. Flag the other for cleanup.
Don't blend conflicting patterns.

### Rule 8 — Read before you write
Before adding code, read exports, immediate callers, shared utilities.
"Looks orthogonal" is dangerous. If unsure why code is structured a way, ask.

### Rule 9 — Tests verify intent, not just behavior
When writing or modifying tests:
Tests must encode WHY behavior matters, not just WHAT it does.
A test that can't fail when business logic changes is wrong.

### Rule 10 — Checkpoint after every significant step
Summarize what was done, what's verified, what's left.
Don't continue from a state you can't describe back.
If you lose track, stop and restate.

### Rule 11 — Match the codebase's conventions, even if you disagree
Conformance > taste inside the codebase.
If you genuinely think a convention is harmful, surface it. Don't fork silently.

### Rule 12 — Fail loud
"Completed" is wrong if anything was skipped silently.
"Tests pass" is wrong if any were skipped.
Default to surfacing uncertainty, not hiding it.

## Tooling
Prefer modern CLI tools: `rg`>`grep`, `fd`>`find`, `sd`>`sed`, `eza`>`ls`. Use classic tools only when the modern one can't express the task safely or exactly.

### File editing

Prefer Anvil MCP tools over the built-in Read/Edit/Write whenever they apply. They ship only the delta, batch multiple edits in one round trip, and avoid full-file reads.

- `anvil-file-batch` — 3+ edits to the same file (collapse into one call)
- `anvil-file-replace-string` / `anvil-file-replace-regexp` — pinpoint replacement; no need to read the whole file first
- `anvil-file-insert-at-line` / `anvil-file-delete-lines` / `anvil-file-append` — localized line-level operations

Use the built-in `Edit` only for small one-off changes. For 3 or more edits to the same file, always use `anvil-file-batch`.

### org-mode

For section moves, refile, splits, or reading a single heading from a large org file, use `anvil-org-*` tools instead of Read+Write. They are 10–20× cheaper in tokens.

- `anvil-org-read-headline` — read a single subtree
- `anvil-org-read-outline` — outline view without bodies
- `anvil-org-edit-body` / `anvil-org-rename-headline` / `anvil-org-update-todo-state` — targeted org edits

### Heavy operations — worker dispatch

Long-running Emacs ops (large tangles, byte-compile, multi-MB org scans, full-tree searches) must not run on the main daemon — they block every other tool call. Dispatch them through the worker pool instead.

- Elisp called from inside Anvil: prefer `anvil-worker-call` over raw `eval` for anything that may exceed ~1s.
- If the worker is registered as its own MCP server (see README "Optional: register the worker pool too"), heavy `eval` calls should target `mcp__anvil-worker__eval` directly so the main session stays responsive.

Symptom that you should have used the worker: the main MCP session stops accepting tool calls for several seconds.

### Scheduled tasks (cron)

If `anvil-cron` tasks are configured (lint, health checks, batch indexers, etc.), do not re-implement their work ad hoc. Inspect and trigger them through the cron MCP tools:

- `anvil-cron-list` — what tasks exist and their schedules
- `anvil-cron-status` — last run time, status, recent failures
- `anvil-cron-run` — fire a registered task on demand

Before writing a new ad-hoc script, check `anvil-cron-list` — the job may already be defined.

### MCP tool self-reinforcement

If during a task you notice any of the following, switch to the appropriate Anvil tool before continuing:

- The same elisp pattern is being written twice in one session
- Three or more `anvil-eval` calls were issued for one logical edit (a single `anvil-file-batch` would have sufficed)
- Repeated full-file Reads of the same large file
- A heavy elisp op blocked the main session — should have been routed via `anvil-worker-call` / `mcp__anvil-worker__eval`

Course-correct mid-task — do not wait until the end.
